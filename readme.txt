**Qualetics - No Code Analytics & AI for your Wordpress Website**
Qualetics enables your Wordpress site with a proactive Self-learning Intelligence so that your website is continuously reporting insights to you that can help you improve your customer outreach and engagement. 

= Analytics & AI =
**Software quality** → Let your Wordpress site report to you how well the site is running, are there any issues while users are browsing your site, where are they experiencing the issues, when and what path are they taking to cause those issues. All this without writing a single line of code! Qualetics helps you to understand the quality, performance and stability of your Wordpress website so that you can proactively get ahead of users facing problems. 

**Product Analytics** → Qualetics helps you unearth insights into how your users interact with your website in this case. You will get to know what actions visitors take on your website so you can enhance the experience of the visitors across your website in entirety. 

**User analytics** → Qualetics helps you unearth insights about your visitors, how much time they spend on a specific page, how many times they visit per day, per week, per month, etc. to name a few. 

**Performance analytics** → This is where it gets interesting for you as a Wordpress website owner. Qualetics lets you know about the overall quality of your software powering your Wordpress website so you can get a fair idea of why or why not visitor traffic is increasing or decreasing. 

**Geo location insights** → Qualetics helps you understand from what all global locations are visitors visiting your Wordpress site. You may want to, in the future, maybe create some content in a local language from the most visited country to have a personalized experience for visitors from such locations.

**User behavior flow** → Wouldn’t it be great if you know exactly where in the entire website visitor experience the visitors faced issues, exceptions, errors, bugs, or friction points? Qualetics helps you to understand the entire user behavior flow on your Wordpress website to let you know exactly what derailed your website visitor experience. 

= Data Ownership =
Your Website, Your Data → With Qualetics, you are the owner of your data, not Google, not Wordpress. Your account will be set up with a dedicated database and not mixed with any other customer account. You can download and have access to the entire data at any given time. 

= Data Management =
Manage multiple sites in one place → If you are an Agency managing multiple customers, track the performance of all your applications in one place. Qualetics multi-tenant platform enables you to manage your entire consortium of Wordpress sites as a single window platform. 

Provision multiple users including your clients → Do you need to submit performance reports to your customers? How about giving them access to their site reports from one central location? Qualetics enables you to manage multiple accounts, create user groups and create user access to specific accounts for greater privacy and ease of management 

= Data Access =
Easily export data into multiple formats → Qualetics enables you to export your analytics and insights through multiple formats such as an Excel spreadsheet, PDF document, etc. so that you have the ability to review those at a later time or the ability to share such insights with a single user or user groups. 
Data Integration
Use REST API to embed insights into other apps → Want access to the user activity data to import it into your own analytics dashboard? Use Qualetics Rest-API to get programmatic access to more than 50 different insights to help you stay informed and make sure you make the most accurate data driven decisions.

= Notification & Alerts =
Get proactive alerts based on conditions you set → What if you are keen to check for specific filtered conditions applicable to your Wordpress website visitors, under normal circumstances, you will have to visit your website analytics dashboard time and again. With Qualetics, you can set a filter for specific conditions to be met and save that view as a favorite. The system will prompt you as and when such conditions are met. 


Now, these are some of the easily transferable benefits of using Qualetics for your Wordpress website.
